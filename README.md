This project is my first attempt at creating a website to better interact with my programs.

On the website, one is able to play a game of Mancala agasint another player or agasint an mini-max AI using alpha-beta pruning.

HTML, JavaScript, and CSS were all used to accomplish this goal of converting a terminal game to a web based game.

Future Improvements:
