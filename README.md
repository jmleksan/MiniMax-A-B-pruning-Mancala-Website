# Mancala Web Game

This project is my first attempt at creating a web-based interface to better interact with my programs. It features a playable version of the classic game **Mancala**, implemented entirely in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

You can play either:
- Against another human locally
- Against an AI opponent that uses the **Minimax algorithm** with **alpha-beta pruning**

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – structure and layout  
- **CSS** – styling and responsive design  
- **JavaScript** – game logic, AI (Minimax + alpha-beta pruning), and interactivity

---

## Features

- Fully playable Mancala game in the browser
- AI opponent with strategic decision-making
- Visual updates for each move, including final score and turn indicators
- Proper endgame logic including seed collection
- Toggle AI on or off at any point during gameplay
